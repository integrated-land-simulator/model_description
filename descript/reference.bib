  abstract  = "AbstractSnow cover is one of the most important variables
               affecting agriculture, hydrology, and climate, but detailed
               measurements are not widely available. Therefore, the
               effectiveness and validity of snow schemes in general
               circulation models have been difficult to assess. Using
               long-term snow cover data from the former Soviet Union, this
               paper focuses on the validation of the snow submodel in the
               Biosphere--Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) using 6 years of
               data (1978--83) at six stations. Fundamental uncertainties in
               the datasets limit the accuracy of our assessment of the model's
               performance.In the absence of a wind correction for the
               gauge-measured precipitation and with the standard rain--snow
               transition criterion (2.2°C), the model gives reasonable
               simulations of snow water equivalent and surface temperature for
               all of the six stations and the six winters examined. In
               particular, the time of accumulation and the end of ablation and
               the alteration due to aging are well captured. With some simple
               modifications of the code, the model can also reproduce snow
               depth, snow cover fraction, and surface albedo. In view of the
               scheme's simplicity and efficiency, these results are
               encouraging.However, if a wind correction is applied to the
               gauge-measured precipitation, the model shows increased
               root-mean-square errors in snow water equivalent for all six
               stations except Tulun. Perhaps, the better agreement without
               wind correction means that the snow has blown beyond the area of
               snow measurement, as might be accounted for only by a detailed
               regional snow--wind distribution model.This study underlines
               four aspects that warrant special attention: (i) estimation of
               the downward longwave radiation, (ii) separation of the aging
               processes for snowpack density and snow surface albedo, (iii)

               the simultaneous transfer of CO2 and water vapor into and out of
               the vegetation, respectively;(ii) use of satellite data, as
               described in a companion paper, Part II, to describe the
               vegetation phonology;(iii) modification of the hydrological
               submodel to give better descriptions of baseflows and a more
               reliable calculation of interlayer exchanges within the soil
               profile;(iv) incorporation of a ``patchy'' snowmelt treatment,
               which prevents rapid thermal and surface reflectance transitions
               when the area-averaged snow cover is low and decreasing.To
               accommodate the changes in (i) and (ii) above, the original

               to a single layer in SiB2. The use of satellite data in SiB2 and

              climate studies at the global and regional scales. The canopy has
              a single layer, whose albedo and bulk coefficients are evaluated
              on the basis of a multilayer canopy model. The fluxes are
              calculated from the energy balance at the ground and canopy
              surfaces in snow-free and snow-covered portions considering the
              subgrid snow distribution. The interception evaporation from
              canopy and the transpiration on the basis of photosynthesis are
              treated. A simplified TOPMODEL is used to calculate runoff. The
              snow has the variable number of layers from one to three in
              accordance with snow water equivalent (SWE), and the snow
              temperature is calculated by a thermal conduction equation.
              Besides, the snowmelt, the refreeze of snowmelt, and the freeze
              of rainfall in snow are taken into consideration. It is found in

              prognosticated from the time passage since last snowfall and the
              snow temperature. The soil has five layers in this version, and

              and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The
              physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a)
              give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and
              leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a
              function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf
              surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An
              energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the
              physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the
              ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and
              empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and
              tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good
              agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An
              over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20--35°C), CO2
              concentrations (10--90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits
              (0.5--3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100--2000 $\mu$mol m−2s−1).
              The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent
              heat flux ($\lambda$E) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course
              of an idealized summer day, using the `big-leaf' approximation.
              Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test
              of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to
              field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday
              depression of $\lambda$E and gs at low or high values of
              boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water
              relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this
              common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider
              this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the
              simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive
              feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in
              gs affects An and $\lambda$E. As a consequence, the temperature,
              humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the
              stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in
              turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible
              significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops
              which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and
              $\lambda$E. The simulations also examine the significance of
              changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component
              of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2
              concentration of the atmosphere.",

               regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy
               balance. Since C4 metabolism shows unique responses to
               environmental conditions and C4 species are important
               agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf
               model specific to C4 plants is needed. In this paper we develop
               a simple model for predicting An and g from leaves of C4 plants
               that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the
               important environmental responses. We derive the leaf model from
               a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C4
               photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP
               carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco
               reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O2
               between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under
               most conditions these processes can be described simply as three
               potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats
               An as first order with respect to either light, CO2 or the
               amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition
               between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf
               photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (TI), intercellular
               CO2 levels and the absorbed quantum flux. A simple linear model
               of g in terms of An and leaf surface CO2 level (ps) and relative
               humidity (hs) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give
               leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T1
               and ps and hs levels. Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves
               exposed to varied light, CO2 and temperature levels are used to
               parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are
               determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements.
               The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set

               While this may be effective in simulating such processes as the
               evolution of ground temperatures and the growth/ablation of a
               snowpack at the soil plot scale, it effectively ignores the role
               topography plays in the development of soil moisture
               heterogeneity and the subsequent impacts of this soil moisture
               heterogeneity on watershed evapotranspiration and the
               partitioning of surface fluxes. This view also ignores the role
               topography plays in the timing of discharge and the partitioning
               of discharge into surface runoff and baseflow. In this paper an
               approach to land-surface modeling is presented that allows us to
               view the watershed as the fundamental hydrologic unit. The
               analytic form of TOPMODEL equations are incorporated into the
               soil column framework and the resulting model is used to predict
               the saturated fraction of the watershed and baseflow in a
               consistent fashion. Soil moisture heterogeneity represented by
               saturated lowlands subsequently impacts the partitioning of
               surface fluxes, including evapotranspiration and runoff. The
               approach is computationally efficient, allows for a greatly
               improved simulation of the hydrologic cycle, and is easily
               coupled into the existing framework of the current generation of

  abstract  = "AbstractWe present a method for calculating the spectral albedo
               of snow which can be used at any wavelength in the solar
               spectrum and which accounts for diffusely or directly incident
               radiation at any zenith angle. For deep snow, the model contains
               only one adjustable parameter, an effective grain size, which is
               close to observed grain sizes. A second parameter, the
               liquid-equivalent depth, is required only for relatively thin
               snow.In order for the model to make realistic predictions, it
               must account for the extreme anisotropy of scattering by snow
               particles. This is done by using the ``delta-Eddington''
               approximation for multiple scattering, together with Mie theory
               for single scattering.The spectral albedo from 0.3 to 5 $\mu$m
               wavelength is examined as a function of the effective grain
               size, the solar zenith angle, the snowpack thickness, and the
               ratio of diffuse to direct solar incidence. The decrease in
               albedo due to snow aging can be mimicked by reasonable increases
               in grain size (50--100 $\mu$m for new snow, growing to 1 mm for
               melting old snow).The model agrees well with observations for
               wavelengths above 0.8 $\mu$m. In the visible and near-UV, on the
               other hand, the model may predict albedos up to 15\% higher than
               those which are actually observed. Increased grain size alone
               cannot lower the model albedo sufficiently to match these
               observations. It is also argued that the two major effects which
               are neglected in the model, namely nonsphericity of snow grains
               and near-field scattering, cannot be responsible for the
               discrepancy. Insufficient snow depth and error in measured
               absorption coefficient are also ruled out as the explanation.
               The remaining hypothesis is that visible snow albedo is reduced
               by trace amounts of absorptive impurities (Warren and Wiscombe,
               1980, Part II).",

               snow water equivalent (SWE) distribution follows a lognormal
               distribution function, and its parameters are physically derived
               from geoclimatic information. Two 29-yr global offline
               simulations, with and without SSNOWD, were performed while
               forced with the Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis (JRA-25) dataset

               Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The snow cover fraction
               was improved by the inclusion of SSNOWD, particularly for the

               experiment with the ECMWF forecast model, a study was carried
               out to examine the model parameterization of evaporation from
               the tropica] oceans. In earlier versions of the model, these
               fluxes were parameterized with neutral transfer coefficients in
               accordance with the Charnock relation with equal coefficients
               for momentum, heat, and moisture. Stability correction was
               applied using Monin-Obukhov theory. This parameterization
               resulted in an extremely weak coupling between atmosphere and
               ocean at wind speeds below 5 m s−1. The transfer coefficients
               for heat and moisture have now been modified for low wind speeds
               to bring them in accordance with the empirical scaling law for
               free convedion. It is shown that these revisions to the transfer
               coefficients at very low wind speeds (1) have a dramatic
               positive impact on almost all aspects of the model's simulation
               of the tropics. These include much improved seasonal rainfall
               distributions (with the virtual elimination of a tendency to
               generate a double ITCZ in both winter and summer), a much
               improved Indian monsoon circulation, and substantially reduced
               tropical systematic errors. The model previously had an eagerly
               bias in the zonal-mean upper tropical tropospheric flow with a
               corresponding cold bias in the deep tropics; it is shown that
               the flux revision substantially reduces this. Furthermore, the
               revision to the fluxes greatly enhances the model's ability to
               represent interannual and intraseasonal variability (see also
               the companion paper by Palmer et al.).",

               motivation for and the contents of the dataset.In June of 1992,
               an interdisciplinary earth science workshop was convened in
               Columbia, Maryland, to assess progress in land-atmosphere
               research, specifically in the areas of models, satellite data
               algorithms, and field experiments. At the workshop,
               representatives of the land-atmosphere modeling community
               defined a need for global datasets to prescribe boundary
               conditions, initialize state variables, and provide near-surface
               meteorological and radiative forcings for their models. The
               International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project
               (ISLSCP), a part of the Global Energy and Water Cycle
               Experiment, worked with the Distributed Active Archive Center of
               the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space
               Flight Center to bring the required datasets together in a
               usable format. The data have since been released on a collection
               of CD-ROMs.The datasets on the CD-ROMs are grouped under the
               following headings: vegetation; hydrology and soils; snow, ice,
               and oceans; radiation and clouds; and near-surface meteorology.
               All datasets cover the period 1987--88, and all but a few are
               spatially continuous over the earth's land surface. All have
               been mapped to a common 1° $\times$ 1° equal-angle grid. The
               temporal frequency for most of the datasets is monthly. A few of

               Circulation Model (GCM) for future climate prediction is
               described and tested for the Greenland Ice Sheet. The model
               builds on previous modeling designed to be forced by automatic
               weather station data, and includes surface energy balance as
               well as processes occurring near the surface such as water
               percolation and refreezing. Surface albedo is calculated with a
               new scheme that differentiates the timescale for aging of wet
               and dry snow and incorporates the effect of a thin layer of
               water and/or fresh snow at the surface. The model was driven
               with automatic weather station data from two sites located in
               the ablation zone in the Kangerlussuaq area (West Greenland),
               and calculated reasonable annual mass balance values (within
               10\% in seven out of eight cases) for four individual and
               consecutive years (1998?2001), using both measured and
               calculated albedo. This implies that the albedo parameterization
               is adequate and climate feedbacks affecting the mass balance are
               well captured. The model was then applied to a distributed
               20-km-resolution grid covering the whole ice sheet, and forced
               with 10 years of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather
               Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA-40) data. With the aim of
               coupling the model to a GCM, this study focuses on the ability
               to model the interannual variability in mass balance rather than
               to assess the present state of balance of the ice sheet. Modeled
               spatial and temporal wet zone extent compares well with
               information derived from passive microwave satellite data.",

               in a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. The new
               dynamic global vegetation model simulates the principal
               processes of the continental biosphere influencing the global
               carbon cycle (photosynthesis, autotrophic and heterotrophic
               respiration of plants and in soils, fire, etc.) as well as
               latent, sensible, and kinetic energy exchanges at the surface of
               soils and plants. As a dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly
               represents competitive processes such as light competition,
               sapling establishment, etc. It can thus be used in simulations
               for the study of feedbacks between transient climate and
               vegetation cover changes, but it can also be used with a
               prescribed vegetation distribution. The whole seasonal
               phenological cycle is prognostically calculated without any
               prescribed dates or use of satellite data. The model is coupled
               to the IPSL-CM4 coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model.
               Carbon and surface energy fluxes from the coupled
               hydrology-vegetation model compare well with observations at

               density in a global simulation are evaluated against

               land--atmosphere interactions and feedbacks within regional and
               global weather, climate, and hydrologic models, a Subgrid SNOW
               Distribution (SSNOWD) submodel that explicitly includes subgrid
               snow-depth and snow-cover variability has been developed. From
               both atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives, the subgrid
               snow-depth distribution is an important quantity to account for
               within large-scale models. In the natural system, these subgrid
               snow-depth distributions are largely responsible for the mosaic
               of snow-covered and snow-free areas that develop as the snow
               melts, and the impacts of these fractional areas must be
               quantified in order to realistically simulate grid-averaged
               surface fluxes. SSNOWD's formulation incorporates observational
               studies showing that snow distributions can be described by a
               lognormal distribution and the snow-depth coefficient of
               variation. Using an understanding of the physical processes that
               lead to these observed snow-depth variations, a global
               distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories
               was developed, and coefficient-of-variation values were assigned
               to each category based on published measurements. In addition,
               SSNOWD adopts the physically realistic approach of performing
               separate surface-energy-balance calculations over the
               snow-covered and snow-free portions of each model grid cell and
               weighing the resulting fluxes according to these fractional
               areas. Using a climate version of the Regional Atmospheric
               Modeling System (ClimRAMS) over a North American domain, SSNOWD
               was compared with a snow-cover formulation similar to those
               currently used in most general circulation models. The
               simulations indicated that accounting for snow-distribution
               variability has a significant impact on snow-cover evolution and
               associated energy and moisture fluxes.",
